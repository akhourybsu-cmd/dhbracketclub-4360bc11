// Rune Delve — Random relic drops (R7)
//
// On a chamber clear, the player has a chance to roll a free relic
// drop — independent of the shard economy. Gives runs a "what will I
// pull?" moment that the game otherwise lacks (today, relics are
// purely bought with shards at the shop).
//
// Drop rate scales with depth so the rare T2/T3 relics show up in
// the chapters where they're actually unlocked. Boss / chapter-boss
// clears get bumps so milestone runs feel rewarding.
//
// Schema-free: drops are persisted via the existing
// rune_delve_relic_unlocks INSERT (rune of `useUnlockRelic`), so no
// migrations needed.

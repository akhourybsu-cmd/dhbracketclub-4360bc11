// Rune Delve — Chamber Layout Zones
//
// Translates the COUNT metadata stored on each `runeLayouts.ts` layout
// (treasureZones, hazardZones, lockedZones) into actual 5×5 grid cell
// coordinates so the play engine can act on them.
//
// The counts were defined ages ago but never wired into the engine —
// every chamber rendered the same plain grid regardless of which
// layout it was assigned. This file fills the gap.
//
// Determinism:
// - All cell assignments use a mulberry32 PRNG seeded from the level's
//   generation seed (offset by +7777 so we don't collide with other
//   consumers of the same base seed).
// - That means the same level always lays out treasure / hazard cells
//   in the same positions for every player. Re-playing the same level
//   doesn't shuffle them around — the player learns the layout.
//
// Effect contract (consumed by RuneDelvePlayPage.handleChain):
// - Treasure cells: when a chain passes through one, the player gets
//   bonus score and a small shard drop per cell. Treasure cells persist
//   across the run (they're a board property, not a tile property —
//   refilling runes doesn't remove the treasure spot).
// - Hazard cells: when a chain passes through one, the player takes
//   small HP damage per cell, capped so a single chain through multiple
//   hazards can't insta-wipe.
// - Locked cells: present in the metadata but NOT yet wired in this
//   first pass. Adding them touches isValidChain (match-validation
//   layer), which is higher risk; reserved for a follow-up.
//
// Allocation order: treasure → hazard → locked. If a layout's combined
// counts exceed half the board (12 cells on 5×5), allocation stops so
// there's always plain board to chain through. In practice no layout
// declares more than ~6 special cells combined, so this safety cap
// never fires today — it's belt-and-suspenders.
